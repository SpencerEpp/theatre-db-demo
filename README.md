### Instructions

If you just want to edit the code follow steps 1-5, if you are deploying a new project follow all steps,
if you are updating the schema follow steps 7-10.<br>

1. Clone this repository, Run command: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/theatre-db-demo.git<br>
2. Cd to project, Run command: cd theatre-db-demo<br>

&nbsp;Note: 2 and 3 are optional but recommended.<br>
&nbsp;3. Run command: python -m venv venv<br>
&nbsp;4. Run command: venv\Scripts\activate<br>

5. Run command: pip install -r requirements.txt<br> 

6. Deploy Railway:<br> 
    a) Go to [https://railway.app](https://railway.app)<br>
    b) Create a new project and deploy it from your GitHub repo (main.py should be in project root folder)<br>
    c) Set the start command in repo settings on railway: python main.py<br>
    d) In the same settings you can generate URL or supply your own domain<br>
    e) Add a **MySQL Plugin** to the project<br>
    f) Go to your Flask service in Railway → `Variables` and add:<br>
    &nbsp;MYSQLHOST = ${mysql.MYSQLHOST}<br>
    &nbsp;MYSQLUSER = ${mysql.MYSQLUSER}<br>
    &nbsp;MYSQLPASSWORD = ${mysql.MYSQLPASSWORD}<br>
    &nbsp;MYSQLDATABASE = ${mysql.MYSQLDATABASE}<br>
    &nbsp;MYSQLPORT = ${mysql.MYSQLPORT}<br>

    g) Deploy the project<br>

7. Open MySQL Workbench, and connect to the db (found in 'Connect to the database MySQL' under the data tab in the MySQL block)<br>
    - Connection Name: Railway<br>
    - Host name: metro.proxy.rlwy.net<br>
    - Port: 36017<br>
    - Username: root<br>
    - Password: ********* (ask spencer for password or get him to update schema)<br>

8. Open Railway connection and import theatre.sql<br>
9. Open schemas tab (bottom left) and right click on railway db, select 'Set as Default Schema'<br>
10. Shift + Ctrl + Enter to run sql file, this will import everything into the hosted db<br>

---

## Updating the Schema
If you want to **wipe and rebuild** the DB from `theatre.sql`:<br>

1. Follow steps 7-10 from above.<br>

## Extra Note
Railway Server can be in a different timezone so the web interface can show a different time than inserted data; however, directly querying the database or using the website will shows correct dates and times.
